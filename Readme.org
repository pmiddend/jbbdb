* jbbdb - parse BBDB from Java

This is a project to parse the [[http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/bbdb.html#SEC67][Insidious Big Brother Database]] (bbdb) files in Java, for access in apps.

** How far along is it?

I can parse my own bbdb file successfully. But I'm not using all the capabilities of bbdb, so please open an issue if anything pops up on your end.

** But it's not Java, it's kotlin!

Yeah, I'm using kotlin because it's easier to handle than Java. It's interoperable though, see [[https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html][interop]].
